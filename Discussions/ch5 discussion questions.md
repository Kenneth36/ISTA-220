1.  What is a compound assignment operator?  How does it work?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   A compound assignment operator is an operator that provides a shorter syntax for assigning the result of an arithmetic operator.  It works as follows:  variable *= number;  variable /= number;  variable %= number;

1.  List all the compound assignment operators.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**  The compound assignment operators are as follows:  ‘*=’, ‘/=’, ‘ %=’,  ‘+=’, ‘ -=’

1.  List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5.  List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   count + 5;  count += 5.   count – 5;  count –= 5;

1.  How long does a while loop run?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   A while loop runs for as long as a condition is true.	

1.  What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   The code will iterate forever.

1.  How many parts does a for loop statement have?  Can you omit any of them?  Can you omit all of them?  What happens if you omit all of them?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**    There are three parts that a for loop statement has.   Yes, you can omit any of the three parts of the for loop statement.  Yes,  you can omit all of the parts.  If you omit all of them you turn the for loop into an infinite loop.

1.  How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   Write the loop as a do….while statement.

1.  What does the break statement do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   The break statement jumps out of the body of an iteration statement.

1.  What does the continue statement do?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   The continue statement does the opposite of the break statement.  It causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately.
