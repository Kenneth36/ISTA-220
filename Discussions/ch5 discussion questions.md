1.  How many parts does a for loop statement have?  Can you omit any of them?  Can you omit all of them?  What happens if you omit all of them?
...**Answer:**    There are three parts that a for loop statement has.   Yes, you can omit any of the three parts of the for loop statement.  Yes,  you can omit all of the parts.  If you omit all of them you turn the for loop into an infinite loop.

1.  How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
