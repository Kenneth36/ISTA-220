1.  What is a class?  According to the book, what does a class “arrange?”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   It is a systematic arrangement of information and behavior into a meaningful entity.  In English…You write a blueprint and everything you build from it has the inheritance of that blueprint.  It arranges information and behavior.

1.  What are the two purposes of encapsulation?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   To combine methods and data within a class and to control the accessibility of the methods and data.

1.  How do you instantiate an instance of a class?  How do you access that instance?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**  Using the keyword new creates an instance of a class. You can access the instance by modifying the definition of a field or method with the public and private keywords.

1.  What is the default access of the fields and methods of a class?  How do you change the default?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**    The default access of the fields and methods of a class is private.  You can change the default of the access by modifying the definition of a field or method with the public and private keywords.

1. What is the syntax for writing a constructor?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   The syntax for writing a constructor is creating an instance of a class that has the same name as the class but does not have any parameters. 

1.  What is the difference between class fields and methods, and instance fields and methods? How do you create class fields and methods?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   Class fields are variables bound to an object and methods are functions bound to an object.  Instance fields and methods 

1.  How do you bring a static class in scope? Why would you want to bring a static class in scope?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   Static using statements enable you to bring a class into scope.  If you have someone else who has to maintain your code.

1.  Can you think of a good reason to create an anonymous class?  What is it?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**    An anonymous class is a class with no name.  You could use it when you need to create a class to do something only one time.

1.  What is polymorphism as this term is used in computer science?  This is not in the book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   Polymorphism in terms of computer science is considered as one interface, multiple functions.  In other words, it is the ability of a method to take on many forms

1.  What is message passing as this term is used in computer science?  This is not in the book.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   Message passing sends a message to a process and relies on the process and the supporting infrastructure to select and invoke the code to run it.

1.  What was the first object-oriented programming language?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language.

1.  Consider this quote by Alexander Stepanov:
  > “I find OOP technically unsound.  It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type.  To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras –families of interfaces that span multiple types.  I find OOP philosophically unsound.  It claims that everything is an object.  Even if it is true it is not very interesting – saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all.”
Who is Alexander Stephanov?  What do you think about this quote?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Answer:**   Alexander Stephanov is a Russian computer programmer who is known as the primary designer and implementer of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) which he started to develop around 1992 when he was employed at HP Labs. I think this quote is dated and is the total opposite of how our world is evolving today.  In some cases I feel it is obsolete.
